"""
The backward step of the simulation smoothers (SBFVAR 0.2.4; the same
helper and tests as MBFVAR 0.9.4, where the failure was found).

The one-step-ahead state covariance that the Carter-Kohn backward step
inverts is singular by construction: the state stacks lagged copies of the
latent series, and the temporal-aggregation constraint is observed without
error. ``smoother_pinv`` inverts it as a Moore-Penrose inverse. These tests
check that it is the ordinary inverse when the matrix is regular, and that
with the singular covariance of an exactly observed four-week mean the
backward step gives the exact Gaussian conditional, computed here
independently from a full-rank parametrisation of the state.
